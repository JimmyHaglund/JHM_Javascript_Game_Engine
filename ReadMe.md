# Jimmy Haglund Malm Static Web Game Framework, JHMEngine

JHMEngine made by me, Jimmy, in order to have a lightweight and simple way to make game applications that can run in a browser window. The engine has been developed as a way to both learn more about Javascript, web, and game development. The engine is entirely front-end, meaning the whole game is loaded as a single web page. This makes is suitable for small projects, but anything larger will require a backend component to dynamically load and unload assets.

The engine was originally written in Javascript and has later been rewritten in Typescript, making development quicker.
