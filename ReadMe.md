# Jimmy Haglund Static Web Game Framework, JHMEngine

JHMEngine was made by me, Jimmy, in order to have a lightweight and simple way to make game applications that can run on a browser. There are better and more feature complete engines out there, but I personally feel that there is a certain freedom and pride that comes with creating something from the "ground up".

Anyone may use this framework to make their own applications, though I'd encourage making your own stuff or finding something more complete first. This was meant as much a learning project as for future use, so I cannot guarantee that it can accomplish your goals or even make them easier to accomplish.
