# Jimmy Haglund Malm Static Web Game Framework, JHMEngine

<<<<<<< HEAD
JHMEngine made by me, Jimmy, in order to have a lightweight and simple way to make game applications that can run in a browser window. The engine has been developed as a way to both learn more about Javascript, web, and game development. The engine is entirely front-end, meaning the whole game is loaded as a single web page. This makes is suitable for small projects, but anything larger will require a backend component to dynamically load and unload assets.

The engine was originally written in Javascript and has later been rewritten in Typescript, making development quicker.

JHMEngine was made by me, Jimmy, in order to have a lightweight and simple way to make game applications that can run in a browser. There are better and more feature complete engines out there, but I personally feel that there is a certain freedom and pride that comes with creating something from the "ground up".

Anyone may use this framework to make their own applications, though I'd encourage making your own stuff or finding something more complete first. This was meant as much a learning project as for future use, so I cannot guarantee that it can accomplish your goals or even make them easier to accomplish.
